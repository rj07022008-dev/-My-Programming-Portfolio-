Title:-
Simple Calculator Using Switch-Case

Description:-

This C++ program implements a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It prompts the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /) and two numeric values. Based on the operator entered, the program performs the corresponding operation and displays the result. If the operator is invalid or if there is an attempt to divide by zero, appropriate error messages are shown.

Run Instructions:

Compile the Program:
Use a C++ compiler (like g++ for Linux/macOS or MinGW for Windows) to compile the code.

g++ -o calculator calculator.cpp

Run the Program:
After compiling, run the program from your terminal or command prompt.
./calculator

Follow the prompts:

Enter an operator (+, -, *, /) when prompted.
Enter two numbers (for the operation) when prompted.

Check the Result:
The program will output the result of the operation, or display an error message if an invalid operator is entered or if division by zero is attempted.
